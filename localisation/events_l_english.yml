election.2.d:0 "In the upcoming election, support for [Root.GetRulingParty] is still high, the people having confidence in [Root.GetLeader]'s leadership. However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action. Cooperating with other major parties who share our concerns for the safety of the nation, we will still be able to rule after the election, albeit with diminished support."

They demand we increase our precautions and ensure that our nation is ready for war. While the majority still support [Root.GetRulingParty], we may lose them to more radical elements if we don't alleviate their apprehensions."

election.4.d:1 "An aggressively nationalist sentiment has grown in [Root.GetName], giving rise to several parties promoting fascist ideals: a state enforcing its power through force. One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."

election.4.b:0 "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
election.5.t:0 "Election: Communists in Government?"
election.5.d:0 "The communist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through cooperating with the government rather than overthrowing it."

The parties in the political middle, even if they choose to set aside their differences, no longer form a majority.

Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathizers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the fascists backing our government."

The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a fascist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."

election.12.d:0 "The current election has resulted in victory for the communist parties, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."

election.13.d:0 "An influential industrialist behind one of the companies we have chosen to work with for our industrial production has recently made a number of statements on politics that members of the administration found troubling. He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."

Normally, an election would be held at this time, but being in the midst of an important conflict many argue that cannot afford to spend time on political campaigning, or a change of leadership if that should come about. Meanwhile, others claim that declaring the ongoing war a valid reason for skipping elections is the first step towards eroding [Root.GetAdjective] democracy. After all, letting military matters take precedence over the people's influence could be a slippery slope."

election.16.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Enjoys Public Support"
election.16.d:0 "With the present election, the opposition, insofar as it exists, has criticized the increasingly authoritarian reign of [Root.GetRulingParty]. They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically. It appears that even if [Root.GetName] is no longer ruled by the people, the people support their ruler... at least the ones who made it to the ballots."
election.16.a:0 "One people, one leader."
election.17.t:0 "Election Results Questioned"
election.17.d:1 "Although the [Root.GetLeader] regime has strong-armed most of its opponents into silence, some have still spoken out about the recent election, accusing the [Root.GetRulingParty] of rigging the results and ignoring the clear efforts to elect a parliament opposed to their policies.\n\nThe government brushes these objections aside as an effort to divide the people against itself. However, the fact remains that the majority of the people seem to have reservations about their rule, and the opposition, although silenced for now, has made its point."

Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."

political.2.d:0 "Although the party line of the [Root.GetRulingParty] is to strongly oppose revolutionary socialism, keeping a watchful eye on the nation's radical left-wing elements, some people in government are more open to the possibility. If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."

political.2.a.tt:0 "If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
political.3.t:0 "Communists Execute Coup"
political.3.d:0 "While the popular movement for communist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
political.3.a:0 "The tides of history will sweep away the past."
political.4.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
political.4.a:0 "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
political.5.t:0 "Soldiers Desert to Communist Partisans"
political.5.d:0 "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
political.5.a:0 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
political.6.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"
political.6.a:0 "Those who wish to make history must act today!"

They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."

political.7.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a fascist coup."
political.8.t:0 "Fascist Sympathies in the Military"
political.8.d:1 "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Fascist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
political.8.a:0 "The national spirit outranks the government."
political.9.t:0 "Fascist Coup d'état"
political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
political.9.a:0 "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
political.10.t:0 "Civil War for Fascism"
political.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
political.10.a:0 "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
political.10.b:0 "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
political.11.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
political.11.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
political.12.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
political.12.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
political.13.t:0 "Move Towards Democracy"
political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."

political.14.t:0 "[Root.GetRulingParty] Debates Democracy"
political.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."
political.14.a:0 "The choice may not always stand between liberty and death."
political.14.a.tt:0 "The government may arrange elections when the policy has majority support."
political.15.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
political.15.a:0 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
political.16.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"

Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

With no side able to break the dead lock in the next years an armistice, with no treaty, was agreed upon in 1945, a peace without victory.

### Balkan League Events ###
balkan.1.t:0 "Welcome to the Mod"
balkan.1.d:0 "This mod is purely based on my megacampaign starting Crusader Kings II as the Count Hvalimir of Rashka in 867, from there on living to 92 to becoming the King of Serbia and eventually forming the Serbian Empire and playing through EU4, Victoria II, and finally HOI3. Everything here has its own authentic history behind it like in real life. \n\n About the Balkan League \n\n Following its defeat in the Great War (1912-1919) the Serbian Empire transformed into the Balkan Republic following Car Lev I's abdication in 1919. Signing the Treaty of Vienna in 1920, the Balkan Republic ceded much of Croatia, Hvaligrad (Constantinople), Aegian Islands , Cyprusm, and Moldova to the victors. The Balkan Republic proved a weak state and following the depression Visarion Belojevic's National Socialist Balkan Worker's Party managed to gain a large base of supporters amongst the population prompting the 1928 Coup which led to a short three month Serbian Civil War where the Balkan Republic was ultimately crushed with minimal casualties. Visarion Belojevic's Balkan League seeks more however than to better the lives of its inhabitants, much of the territory ceded, particularly Croatia, contains ethnic Serbs/Croats which rightfully belong within our borders. Although there are limits on how much aircraft/naval power/men in service we can have surely we can bypass the rules, for the sake of our own protection that is..."

For every year following April 20th had been remembered as the year of the formation of what grew to be our country and celeberated with a large feast at the capital which gradually turned into Military Parade over the times. Since our defeat in the First World War, the yearly Union Parade came to a halt and had been forbidden by the Treaty of Munich, however despite this, this year the Military Parade will be occuring in the capital after roughly 18 years. A show off of Land and Air with an additional launching of the Battleship UBN Hvalimir will be part of it."

He makes an important point that even though the army and the airforce will win the war on land, if an effort to focus on the sea is not made the war on land will ultimately be lost as our vulnerability and susceptibility towards nations such as the Vizantiyan Empire and the United Kingdom are large when it comes to naval invasions and naval blockades. \n\n Budayev is urging us to start an expansion on the navy, however, such an expansion will not be cheap."

This has prompted the South German government to increase military activity in the city of Zagreb and it is reported there have been severe crackdowns and violation of liberties of the citizens who have been reportedly assaulted by the South German military garrison.\n\n The South German government has deemed the perpetrators "South Slavic Terrorists", but it is obvious that the people's of Croatia desire to be reintgrated into the League.

balkan.7.d:0 "Ever since the end of the Great War and the signing of the despicable Treaty of Vienna the state of Muntenia has been under the occupation of an allied contingent, mostly made up by Hungarian soldiers. The main reason for the particular occupation of Muntenia has been the rich oilfields of Ploesti which also helped pay off Serbian war debts following failiure of the Balkan Republic to pay war reparations on time in the twenties, the oil wells have also been leased to the victorious nations for fifty years.\n\n As Visarion Belojevic said, we have had enough of this, it may be one thing to have to lease our oil wells but it is another to have those filthy Hungarians and their South German allies with their military garrisons on our land like they own it! If they won't leave on their own, it is our duty to show them to door back to their countries and let us keep ours!"

Considering our navy is by far from something to be reckoned with, this would be a good opportunity to strengthen our defenses in the case of lacking needed naval superiority in the future..."

balkan.9.d:0 "Instead of giving us Croatia which we have been pushing for the reunification of, to which the South German Confederation and Kingdom of Hungary strongly disagreed upon, the British have come in to keep the situation calm. So whilst we would not be getting Croatia, for now..., we would still get a substantial peace of territory and one of our old colonies back. \n\n North Africa would definately be worth taking, Croatia, we will get it back some other time when we are *cough* more prepared..."

balkan.11.t:0 "Treaty of Vienna Issue"
balkan.11.d:0 "The Treaty of Vienna (1919), has been the absolute bane of our existance. Not only did we have to give away our rightful territory which has been part of the Serbian Empire for hundreds of years but we had to lick the boots of the victors and pay huge sums of war reparations as well as having our military limited to basically nothing. Yet those victors themselves continue building up and maintaining their large militaries, probably with the help of our war reparations too! This treaty is an absolute abominiation, and it must be dealt with immediately!"
balkan.11.a:0 "I will rip it up myself"
balkan.11.b:0 "We must face the consequences of our actions"
balkan.12.t:0 "Budayev vs Balasevich"
balkan.12.d:0 "Our admiral, Nataniyel Budayev, a Great War veteran himself is urging for the construction of a larger navy for which he claims is absolutely essential in the 'possibility' of war, whilst his program is far more expensive, he makes a strong point that if we do not build up our navy we will be stuck on our own island we created and cut off from the rest of the world which whilst might not be a problem at first could and would be an absolute death sentence in the end! On the other end of the spectrum is Admiral Alexander Balasevich, a Great War veteran himself Balasevich urges for a strong focus on submarine warfare, he claims that not only would such a project be cheaper than Budayev's huge and costly Battleships but faster and could easily starve our enemies from supply."

balkan.12.b:0 "I like Balasevich's idea more"
balkan.13.t:0 "Issue with the Monarchists"
balkan.13.d:0 "Ever since the forced abdication of Car Lev I in 1919 which ended the First World War the monarchists have been relatively pushed away from politics with the formation of the democratic Balkan Republic, although there was an idea to form a constitutional monarchy but severely limit the Car's power the idea never went through. \n\n However, with the rise of the NSBWP the monarchists have made a comeback. Seeing it as an opportunity to get back into power they have supported us and we have somewhat used them to boost our popularity with other pro-monarchist populations. But we have never intended to actually make use of them, as the monarchy is in the past and this is now the present."
balkan.13.a:0 "The monarchy is in the past"
balkan.13.b:0 "Perhaps we should look to restore it?"
balkan.14.t:0 "Restoration of Industry"
balkan.14.d:0 "Since the end of the Great War the victor nations have spit quite a lot on the corpse of the former Serbian Empire, such as dismantling a large portion of our industry for their own selfish use and as a consequence of our failiure to meet reparations during the mid 20's. We should look back to restoring our industry to its previous state and beyond."
balkan.14.a:0 "Okay"
balkan.15.t:0 "The Russian Threat"
balkan.15.d:0 "While we may have won in the main European Theatre and control the large majority of the continent there is still one large issue at play. That would be the Russian Empire, of course while the Russians have indeed declared neutrality in this conflict it would not be unlikely that the United Kingdom, this very second, is doing all they can to get them to join the war against us. \n\n The issue with waiting out the Russian threat is that it they could invade us, more or less a question of when than if, the United Kingdom will get its way. Russia will join them eventually, either from their own fear of lack of protection and balance of power in Europe or from Britain's guarantees and offerings. \n\n This is a dangerous game and we must make the first move to win it."
balkan.15.a:0 "Worrying..."
balkan.16.t:0 "Allied Rubber Issue"
balkan.16.d:0 "Whilst the allies have largely been cut off from their rubber supply with the ongoing war in Asia, which has no doubt hampered them, the still have one secret ally in South America who will non-the-less keep supplying them. \n\n That secret ally would be Brazil, if we could try and convince Argentine to join the League Alliance and invade Brazil taking control of the rubber, it would make the allies completely cut off from the resource and thus severaly hamper their war effort."
balkan.16.a:0 "Sounds like a great idea!"
balkan.17.t:0 "Dezarussiya Liberated"
balkan.17.d:0 "After fierce fighting the United Balkan Army were able to capture the city of Dezarus, known as the jewel of Eastern Europe. With the capture of Dezarus the United Balkan Army has paraded throughout the city and Visarion Belojevic gave Vovannslav II who had been the previous king before the annexation, the crown back to the Kingdom of Dezarussiya. Vovannslav II then awarded all soldiers involved with the 'Dezarussian Hero' medal and urged his people to fight on against the Russian beast saying "We must defeat the Russian Empire, if we do not I am afraid not only will our nation be devoured by the giant forever to be lost in history, but our people will dissapear with it forever as well. I have lost this crown before, but I am not here for the crown I am here for our freedom!." \n\n These are dark times for the world but this is the Legacy of Dezarussiya."

A daring move on the part of our leader, he has assured us that the allied nations will not retaliate and we will not engage, it will simply be a peaceful transition of military control. Belojevic gave his speech at Sofia saying "Is Muntenia not part of the Balkan League? Are we not allowed to have control over our own territory, where OUR people live? This is not just a demilitarized zone, this is a foreign occupation, I would myself like to see how the Hungarians or South Germans would react if we 'demilitarized' one of their states!"

In its depravity and defeneracy it has now become insufferable, Croatia was a South Slavic territory and is a South Slavic Territory! Hvaligrad was a South Slavic city and still is! These regions owe their cultural development exclusively to the South Slavic peoples. Without us these regions would still be plunged into the depths of barbarism, Croatia, Slovenia, Istria, Western Transdanubia, Moldova, Crete, and Hvaligrad were torn from us! The now South Slavic minorities living there have been persecuted in the vilest manners imaginable, in the years following the Great War over one million men of South Slavic blood were forced to leave their homeland. As always, me and the Prvak have sought to bring about a change by peaceful means, by offering proposals but the time for proposals is over. I, like you cannot bear to see the suffering of our peoples outside of our borders as minorities, there are limits to everything.""

If these nations such as the South German Confederation claim to be 'democracies' for what reason do they ignore the cries of the South Slavic people's wishes to be reunited with the rest of the fatherland?"
