 ROAD_TO_WAR_NAME:0 "The Road to War"
 ROAD_TO_WAR_DESC:0 "It has been eighteen years since the end of the Great War and the Balkan League headed by the ambitious leader 'Prvak' Visarion Belojevic seeks to re-establish their former military might and regain their territory. Nations previously allied against the former Serbian Empire might seek the opportunity to ally with them and carve up their territorial ambitions but will democracy ultimately be able to triumph and crush these authoritarian and opportunist governments?"
 BAL_ROAD_TO_WAR_DESC:0 "The Balkan League was established in 1928 after a the short three month 'Serbian Civil War' between the weak and unpopular Balkan Republic and the popular National Socialist Balkan Worker's Party, also known as the Yushist's. The League headed by the ambitious Visarion Belojevic, a First World War veteran who fought on the South German Front, seeks to re-establish its former glory and seeks vengeance upon those who humiliated the country in the Treaty of Dezarus (1919). Surrounded by democracies which seek peace the League may get what it wants at first but this can only go on for so long..."
 FRA_ROAD_TO_WAR_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of France has constantly been threatened from the south by the former Kingdom of Aquitaine, although seeking to unite the Occitan region into the Kingdom of France many times in the past, such an attempts have never succeeded. Although France has been a victor in the First World War, it still sees itself surrounded by more enemies, Aquitaine seeking revenge, and the North German Confederation which seeks to dominate France's South German allies and form a united German State."
 NGF_ROAD_TO_WAR_DESC:0 "The North German Confederation has been amongst the victors in the First World War. However, despite this and the conederations great territorial gains from the Kalmar Union and Poland-Moravia the North German Emperors have always had their eyyes on dominating the South German Region and unting Germany into one super state. Such however has not been possible, but perhaps cooperating with radical Balkan League could help us finally outmaneuver and form this superstate once and for all."
 SGF_ROAD_TO_WAR_DESC:0 "The South German Confederation has been amongst the victors in the First World War. Although it has enjoyed it's fair share of the spoils, particularly regaining lost territory from the Balkan League and the valuable industrial region of Croatia. Ultimately however, the South German Confederation is sandwhiched between three very large potential enemies, the Balkan League, the North German Confederation, and the Union of Soviet Italian Republics. Will this beacon of democracy prevail in surrounded by totalitarian and autocratic governments which seek to dismantle it?"
 RUS_ROAD_TO_WAR_DESC:0 "The Russian Empire, being amongst the victors (and instigator of WWI) has enjoyed significant expansion taking a large chunk of Poland in the paritition of Poland-Moravia following the Treaty of Dezarus (1919). But none-the-less the Russian Empire is no friend of democracy, the only reason it was a part of the allies in the First World War was because of the South German fear of the growing power of the Serbian Empire and found themselves common enemies for different reasons. Due to this the Russian Empire ultimately seeks neutrality in any European conflict prefering a degree of isolationism and dealing with their internal complications with a steady rise of revolutionaries whom seek to dismantle the corrupt monarchy."
 VIZ_ROAD_TO_WAR_DESC:0 "The Vizantiyan Empire gained a significant chunk of territory from the Balkan League following their victory in the Great War. Constantinople was after several hundred years returned along with the Aegian Islands, Rhodes, and a fair chunk of the rich former Serbian Imperial Navy. But the Vizantiyan Empire has largely been facing many internal issues, with a majority of Turks/Muslims living in the eastern region driving dissent and de-stabilizing the country. In the west the Balkan League headed by Visarion Belojevic seeks to take back what is theirs and maybe even more..."
 USA_ROAD_TO_WAR_DESC:0 "The Union was forced to reluctantly agree to give the Confederacy independence as well as in the Second Civil War otherwise known as the 'Continuation War' where defeat was suffered again. Although there were tensions in the North American continent during the Great War, a war fortunately never erupted between the Confederacy and the United States but will the United States be able to avoid conflict in this next great war?"
 OTHER_ROAD_TO_WAR_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, will be affected by this conflict between the shades of gray. Nobody in this world is innocent, nobody is evil, nobody is right, and nobody is wrong. Will you seek to uphold the beacon of democracy and freedom or fall into the hole of nationalism and seek to ally yourself to other authoritarian states whom seek to better their countries at the cost of others."
